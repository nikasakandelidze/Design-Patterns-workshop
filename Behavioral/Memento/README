Memento Design pattern:
       Without braking encapsulation of an object, catch and save it's internal state
       and later you can restore object to it's previous state easily.

    Undo operation of each and every application is exactly what Memento design pattern is.
    Each and every time you press ctrl+z, you use Memento design pattern under the hood.

    Memento - actual object representing whole/or part of Originator.
    Originator  - Main object, whose state you want to snapshot.
    CareTaker - Never operated or examines memento's internals,
