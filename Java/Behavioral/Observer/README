Observer Design pattern:

    Description:
        Define one to many dependencies for objects, so that when one object changes
        all others are notified and react to this change in some way.

    Examples:
        Listeners - in java, all follow this design pattern.
        In MVC architecture MVC.Controller is usually listener of MVC.Model.

    In this concrete example(src code):
        Controller ----(listens to)---->Model
        whenever model changes it notifies all it's listeners about this change.
        listeners do their job when notified about this change
        (Controller updates view as soon as gets model change alarm).
