Bridge design pattern:
    Main idea of bridge pattern is to decouple abstraction from it's implementation
    so that they can vary independently.

    Bridge pattern mainly is about preffering composition over inheritance.Implementation details are pushed from
    current object to the outside world.

    <<<<<<<<Important>>>>>>>>
Using this pattern we can make some properties of classes exchangeable at runtime
(without touching class'es internals) just by varying between different Implementations.
