Singleton Pattern.

Don't get confused when looking to examples,
The word samshoblo means motherLand, and in Georgian there are well known words:
        "Samshoblo rogorc upali ertia qveyanazeda" ---> Basically saying Motherland/samshblo is Singleton for every person in each country.

Definition/Intent:
        Ensure that class has only one instance and provide global access point to it.

It's important/strictly needed for some classes to have only one instance, and
all other modules of application go up to this single instance whenever needed.

Restrict class to have only one instance.
