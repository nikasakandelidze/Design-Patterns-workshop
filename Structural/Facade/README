Facade Design pattern:
    Provide unified interface to the set of interfaces in a sub-system.
    Facade just creates higher-level abstraction layer/unifying interface for client, to make subsystem easy to use.

    <<<<Important>>>>
    It shields client from complexities of internal components,
    JDBC is example of facade, as we create connection using one method, not knowing anything
    about inner implementations.
