Composite Design pattern:

    Compose objects into a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.
    It lets client treat individual objects and compositions/groups of these objects the same way.
    --------------------
    So some object and group of these kinds of objects implement one and the same interface, and
    both of them can be treated with the same interface(This actually gives this pattern tree structure).

Components:
    BaseComponent - actual interface that everything in here implements
    LeafComponent - actual concrete implementations/working objects of BaseComponent interface
    Composite - class that extends BaseComponent but also has group of BaseComponents in itself.
